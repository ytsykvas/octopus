```

**One title bar across the window**, not one strip per pane. Each pane used to
draw its own, which pushed the tab strip's fill up behind the traffic lights and
put the project name under them. Its left padding clears the buttons outright,
so nothing depends on how wide the tab strip happens to be.

**Projects are a tab strip**; workspaces are a list of the active one. Conductor
puts both in one tree, which outgrows the window and makes a click mean two
things — select and fold. Splitting them means neither list grows with the other.

**The right pane** holds Changes, Terminal, Build and Server. Build runs
`setup.sh`, Server runs `run.sh` with the workspace's port in `$OCTOPUS_PORT`.
Both run on a button: starting a server because a tab was clicked is a surprise.

Both side panes are resizable and their widths persist. The right pane's ceiling
is whatever the window has left after the sidebar and a usable centre, so it
grows on a large display without a number to maintain.

## Colour

Tokens only, declared twice — `:root` and `.dark` — in
[`styles.css`](../src/renderer/src/styles.css). **Never a raw hex in a
component**, or the dark theme breaks.

Surfaces: `canvas` → `surface` → `muted`, separated by `line` and `line-strong`.
Text: `ink` → `ink-soft` → `ink-faint`. Status colours apply to text and icons;
only the paired `*-bg` is used as a background.

### Project colours

Fifteen, `--project-<name>`, one pair per theme. The colour is **stored on the
project**, not derived from its name — a hash would repaint a project the moment
it was renamed, and constancy is what makes it recognisable.

Applied by setting `--project-color` inline on a container. That inline style is
the sanctioned exception: the value is dynamic, but still resolves to a token.

Two rules that are easy to get wrong:

- **Text on a filled colour uses `--project-ink`**, not `#fff`. The dark theme
  uses brighter values on purpose, where white is barely legible.
- **Measure contrast, do not judge it.** Five colours looked fine and sat
  between 3.3:1 and 4.1:1 against white — under the 4.5:1 body text needs.

## Selection is a relationship, not a highlight

The instinct is to make the selected thing the brightest. Browser tabs do the
opposite, and they are right: the active tab is the panel reaching back.

So the active project tab takes exactly the colour the sidebar's gradient starts
with, runs to the strip's edge and squares off, with no line between them. Two
consequences generalise:

- **surfaces meant to join must start at the same coordinate** — four pixels of
  padding broke the effect outright;
- **delete the redundant signal** — once the tab visibly joined the panel, the
  marker beside it was a second answer to a question already answered.

Where selection cannot be shown by relationship, show it by **hue, not
brightness**. The right pane's active tab used a muted fill that measured
1.09:1 against the pane behind it: two greys a fraction apart, invisible.

## Ready-made classes

`.panel` · `.row` / `.row-selected` · `.input` · `.section-label` ·
`.focus-ring` · `.titlebar-drag` · `.project-tinted`

The second copy of a run of utility classes belongs here. Six copies of the
field styling had already drifted by a few pixels of height.

## Shared components

| Component                                                       | Worth knowing                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Modal`                                                         | body has **no padding** — a list spans the full width, a form brings its own. A backdrop click does not close it. `lg` is a fixed height so sectioned dialogs do not resize between sections |
| `DropdownMenu`                                                  | positioned against the **window**, not its trigger — an absolute panel is clipped by any scrolling ancestor, and the tab strip is one                                                        |
| `Combobox`                                                      | a select with search; a native one stops being usable around thirty entries                                                                                                                  |
| `SectionRail`                                                   | the rail shared by both settings dialogs                                                                                                                                                     |
| `Field`, `FileEditor`, `NameEditor`, `ResizeHandle`, `Terminal` |                                                                                                                                                                                              |

`Button` has four variants: `accent`, `quiet`, `danger` (subdued destructive),
`destructive` (filled, for the action a confirmation is asking about).

## State

Two hooks own everything that talks to IPC: `useProjects` and `useWorkspaces`.
A component that lays out a window should not also know what an IPC failure
looks like.

The split is not all-or-nothing: `useProjects.remove` asks and deletes, while
`App` clears the selection afterwards — what points at a project is the window's
business.

## Two lint rules that will stop you

- **No `setState` in an effect.** State derived from a prop is adjusted during
  render (`if (activeId !== lastActiveId) { … }`); state that follows an event
  is set in the handler.
- **No reading a ref during render.** A ref is not an escape hatch from the
  rule above; both were rejected in turn while writing `WorkspaceTerminals`.

## Localisation

No user-facing string appears inline. Keys live in
[`i18n/locales/`](../src/renderer/src/i18n/locales/), English first — `uk.ts` is
typed against `en.ts`, so a missing key is a compile error.

**Delete a key when its last caller goes.** A key nothing reads is a claim about
the interface that has quietly stopped being true, and it survives every check:
`en.ts` types `uk.ts`, but nothing types either against the code.
